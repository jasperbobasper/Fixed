# Fixed
Fixed point number Class Template for C++ 

This is currently a WIP, 
not super functional yet. 

In the process of writing a unit test to get this bad boy up and running 


#### Why are you doing this????
Great question. I famously do not love math, but we had an assignment to make a basic implementation of a Fixed point number class. At the time I found it very interesing and recently as I was looking back at some older projects I was like "I should take this further"

Will I ever actually use this? Maybe? But probably not

Am I having fun making it? Somehow yes. 

That's it :)
